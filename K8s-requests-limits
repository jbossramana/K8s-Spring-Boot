Resource Management for Pods and Containers
--------------------------------------------

When you specify a Pod, you can optionally specify how much of each resource a container needs. The most common resources to 
specify are CPU and memory (RAM); there are others.


Requests and limits
-------------------

If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and allowed) for a container to use more 
resource than its request for that resource specifies. However, a container is not allowed to use more than its resource limit.

For example, if you set a memory request of 256 MiB for a container, and that container is in a Pod scheduled to a Node with 8GiB 
of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use more RAM.


Resource requests and limits of Pod and container
-------------------------------------------------

For each container, we can specify resource limits and requests, including the following:

spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory
spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>
spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory
spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>



Container resources example
---------------------------

The following Pod has two containers. Both containers are defined with a request for 0.25 CPU and 64MiB (226 bytes) of memory. 
Each container has a limit of 0.5 CPU and 128MiB of memory. You can say the Pod has a request of 0.5 CPU and 128 MiB of memory, 
and a limit of 1 CPU and 256MiB of memory.
