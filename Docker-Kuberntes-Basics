Docker Image
============

A Docker image is a read-only template used to create Docker containers.

It contains:

Application code (e.g., Spring Boot JAR)

Base OS (e.g., Alpine, Ubuntu)

Runtime (e.g., JDK)

Configuration (env variables, ports)

You can version, share, and reuse images.

## Think of it as a blueprint 


Docker Container 
================

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image.

It's isolated, lightweight, and shares the host OS kernel.

You can start, stop, and destroy containers quickly.

It’s like a small runtime OS box running your app.

Think of it as a meal made from the image.


Spring Boot Application Instance
================================

A Spring Boot app instance is a JVM process running your Spring Boot application.

It’s created by running:

java -jar app.jar

It includes your app code, configurations, dependencies, and embedded server.

It’s the actual application running, serving business logic or APIs.


Virtual Machine (VM)
====================

A VM is a full-blown virtual computer.

It includes:

Virtualized CPU, memory, storage

A full OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)

Runs on a hypervisor like VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM.

Heavyweight compared to containers.

Think of it as a fully equipped house vs a container (tiny home).

Docker container:
=================

A lightweight, standalone container running your app — isolated with its own filesystem, processes, network, etc.

Kubernetes Pod:
===============

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

It can hold one or more containers (usually Docker containers).

Containers inside the same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate via localhost.

They also share storage volumes and some resources


Why Pod?
========

1. Group Containers That Work Together

Sometimes an application needs multiple containers tightly coupled and sharing resources — for example:

A main app container (e.g., your Spring Boot app)

A helper container (e.g., logging or sidecar proxy)
Kubernetes bundles these into a single Pod so they share the same network IP, storage volumes, and lifecycle.

2. Shared Network and Storage

All containers in a Pod:

Share the same IP address and port space

Can communicate via localhost

3. Share storage volumes (e.g., persistent disks)

This makes inter-container communication fast and simple.

Atomic Scheduling and Lifecycle
Pods are the smallest unit Kubernetes schedules on nodes.
If a Pod dies, Kubernetes recreates the entire Pod (all containers inside), ensuring consistency.

4. Simplifies Management

By grouping related containers, Kubernetes can manage them as one unit — simplifying deployment, scaling, and updates.



Pod can have multiple containers running Spring Boot apps?
==========================================================

Yes, but it’s not common or recommended to run multiple instances of the same app inside one Pod.

Why?

A Pod is meant to run one “main” app container, plus optionally some small helper containers (called sidecars) that assist the main container.

Running multiple copies of the same Spring Boot app inside one Pod defeats the purpose of Kubernetes scaling and isolation.

|  (Smallest deployable Kubernetes unit)|
|                                       |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
|  | Spring Boot Application      |      |
|  | (Main container running app) |      |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
|                                       |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
|  | Logging Sidecar Container    |      |
|  | (Handles log shipping/agent) |      |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
|                                       |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
|  | Other Sidecar Container      |      |
|  | (e.g., metrics, proxy)       |      |
|  +-----------------------------+      |
+---------------------------------------+

Pod groups multiple containers that work closely.

Containers inside the Pod share the same IP address, port space, and storage.

Sidecars assist the main app container with logging, metrics, proxies, etc.


What is a Sidecar Container?
============================

Sidecar is a design pattern in Kubernetes and container orchestration.

A sidecar is a helper container that runs alongside the main application container inside the same Pod in Kubernetes.

It supports or enhances the main container by handling additional tasks.

Examples of Sidecar Uses:
=========================

Logging: Collects and ships logs from the main app.

Proxy: Manages network traffic for the main app (e.g., service mesh sidecar like Envoy).

Monitoring: Gathers metrics or health info.

Configuration: Syncs config files or certificates.


Kubernetes Concepts — Simplified
================================

1. Pod

The smallest unit in Kubernetes.

A Pod is one or more containers (usually one) running together on the same machine, sharing storage, network, and specs.

Example: A Pod might run your Spring Boot app container.

2. ReplicaSet

Ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are always running.

If a Pod dies, the ReplicaSet creates a new one to maintain the desired count.

Think of it as the "Pod babysitter".

3. Deployment

Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods.

You describe the desired state (e.g., 3 replicas of a Pod running your app), and the Deployment handles creating/updating/deleting ReplicaSets and Pods.

Makes rolling updates and rollbacks easy.

4. Service

Exposes your Pods to other Pods or external users.

Provides a stable IP and DNS name to access your app, even if Pods change or move.

Can load balance traffic across multiple Pods.
